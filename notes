Stuff Jolie should have:

Proper error message when you accidentally define request_responsen as [ask(req)(res)] instead of [ask(req)(res){...}]. Right now it just sends output as void, which results in a type mismatch. That's misleading.

Default variable when doing request response, so you don't need {str = "This is the request"} and a custom data type for the request.

You should be allowed to write ; after the last statement in a {} block.

Another name. So you could actally google stuff about it without getting hits on Angelina Jolie. Because that's the only thing showing up rn.

Variables should be initialised. A spelling error in a variable name may never be discovered.



Fint - bemærk dog at man selv skal kode sin broker og også selv sørge for at beskeder kom frem i rækkefølge.
